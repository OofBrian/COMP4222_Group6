# Evaluation Scripts

This repository contains scripts for evaluating models with and without RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). The following scripts are provided:

## Files

1. **`No_Rag_main.py`**
   - This script is used for evaluation **without RAG**.
   - Make sure to update the dataset name in the script before running it.

2. **`Hipporag_main.py`**
   - This script is used for evaluation **with HippoRAG**.
   - Similar to `No_Rag_main.py`, you need to modify the dataset name in this script for proper evaluation.

## Note

- Both files require you to **change the dataset name** inside the scripts to select the dataset you want to evaluate on.
- The available evaluation datasets can be found in the following directory:
